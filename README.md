# SeeingInColour
Utilizing ofxOpenCV and OpenFrameworks, I developed a software that tracks two objects of different colors.

Software features:
  - Tracks the position of the two colored objects
  - Informs the user when objects are detected or lost
  - Notifies the user when the two objects are close to each other
  - Allows users to choose the colors they want to detect through a GUI
